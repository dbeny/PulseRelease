# Pulse Racing
Racing application mainly made for Grand Theft Auto, but can be used to almost everything. You connect to a server then over the race you receive all the flags and messages at the same time as everyone. No Discord voice chat, or in-game chat is needed.

The app runs on the top-right of your screen, taking over a small space and it is on top of everything, so you don't have to worry about needing a second monitor or anything like that. Here's a little preview:

## How to use:
- After opening the application you should see a gear icon on the top left, click it.
- You then have to input your name (maximum of 16 characters, your Social Club name is preferred if playing GTA to make the Race Director's life easier)
- Enter the code you've been given by the Race Director (maximum of 4 characters, all numbers).
- Click join.
- If you see "connected as (your name here)" you are set!

### Massive thanks for everyone contributing to the project either by ideas, coding or by testing!
